    <h1 style="text-align:center;"> For our first project, my team created a buzz-feed style quiz that collected user inputs about their personality and determined what kind of house would be best for them. To Accomplish this, we first made individual house files, then created a quiz that utilized a points system that would import a specific house file depending on the points the user recieved at the end of the quiz.</h1>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;"> For our second project, my team created a randomized maze game. The goal of the game was to complete the maze as many times as possible in 1 minute. The maze would reset and randomize each time it was completed.</h1>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;"> For our third project, my team created a clicker game in which you click on the main sprite, called Frank, to rack up a high score. There are multiple shop pages with power ups you can buy, and the goal of the game is the get the largest score possible. </h1>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">For our fourth project, my team was required to analyze data sets to determine the location of a rover on an unknown planet. Our group chose the Inland Forests as the graphs we produced coincided with this biome the most. Graph 1 represents light level, which shows low ambient light the best. Graph 2 represents the high howl of wind, with breaks to represent occasional thunderstorms. Graph 3 represents the wind level, as it shows low levels to represent little to no wind and is more representative of a wind graph in general. Finally, Graph 4 represents the smooth variation of temperature, as the temperature in the forest varies slightly but is mostly constant.</h1>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;"> For our fifth project, my team was required to analyze data obtained from the internet, process it, and visualize it in multiple graphs. We created graphs for the relationship between state, year, and honeyproduction, and sorted it by ranges of honey production. We created multiple types of graphs with unique styles. <h1>
