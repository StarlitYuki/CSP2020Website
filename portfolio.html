    <h1 style="text-align:center;"> For our first project, my team created a buzz-feed style quiz that collected user inputs about their personality and determined what kind of house would be best for them. To Accomplish this, we first made individual house files, then created a quiz that utilized a points system that would import a specific house file depending on the points the user recieved at the end of the quiz.</h1>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;"> For our second project, my team created a randomized maze game. The goal of the game was to complete the maze as many times as possible in 1 minute. The maze would reset and randomize each time it was completed.</h1>
